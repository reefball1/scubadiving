                <h1>Why learn to dive?</h1>
                <li>Imagine floating weightlessly like an astronaut, watching colorful fish, or exploring shipwrecks.
                    Scuba diving immerses you in a world that many people never get to see firsthand. With your Open
                    Water Scuba Diver certification, you gain access to this world in a safe and educated manner. </li>
                <li>Scuba diving is not just another sport; it's a transformative experience that allows you to witness
                    life under the waves. It is an activity that can be enjoyed at almost any age and can be combined
                    with travel to some of the most beautiful destinations in the world. </li>
                <li>Underwater is one of the few places in the world where you can truly 'check out'. No emails, text
                    messages, or social media while diving!</li>
                <li><em>It's also an excellent gift for the family member who has always wanted to dive!</em></li>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Top 5 Reasons You Should Become a Scuba Diver</h1>

    <section class="why-page-second-section">
        <div class="why-page-text-side">
            <ol>
                <li>There is so much to explore. Earning a scuba certification does more than just allow you to breathe
                    underwater (although that’s really, really cool.) It opens the door for you to go to places few
                    people have gone before.
                    <ul>
                        <li>From vast oceans to crystal clear lakes, there is a huge world out there just ready for you
                            to join it.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Marine life is just better up close. There are millions of species out there. Sure, you can go to an aquarium and see some fish. But why not join them in their natural environment, up close and in person? Nothing compares to seeing a massive sea turtle or moray eel in their natural habitat.
                </li>
                <li>Freedom and tranquility. It’s hard to explain just how freeing it feels to escape gravity for the first time.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            There is something so peaceful about having all of the weight in your life lifted away as you float through the quiet, serene seascapes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="why-page-text-side">
            <ol>
                <li value="4">It’s an amazing social activity. Diving is the perfect activity for couples, friends, and family. You will learn new ways to communicate with each other underwater and you will improve your appreciation for each other when on land as well. There are tons of divers out there looking for the perfect dive buddy to join them in the water. Plus, if you have kids, they can take the Junior Open Water Diver course and earn their certification alongside you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It gets you moving. Many of us don’t get out as much as we should, but once you start diving, you won’t think of anything else. Scuba is an outdoor activity and whether you choose to explore the vast, flowing seas or a relaxing, shallow lake, you will find yourself becoming a more active and exciting person.
                </li>
