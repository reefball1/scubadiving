# Scuba Diving Website

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for my dad's scuba dive instructor website. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for various pages such as about, why dive, pricing, advanced certifications, etc.

## Note on Local Usage
When opening the project locally, please note that the navigation buttons may not function as expected. This is because the `href` attributes in the HTML are set up with paths like `contact` instead of `contact.html`. This design choice is intended to hide the `.html` extension in the browser URL when the site is hosted online.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
